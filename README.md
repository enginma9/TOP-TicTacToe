# TOP-TicTacToe

[Play the game](https://enginma9.github.io/TOP-TicTacToe/)  

Submission for the Odin Project  
Uses an adjusted version of the minimax function for the ai.  
If you just want to see the ai functions without all the extras, I've included the [Testing page](https://enginma9.github.io/TOP-TicTacToe/Test/), under the Test folder in this repo.
